    <h1> Visualizing the Global Relationship between Vaccines and Disease Incidence Rate </h1>
	<p> Measles is one of the leading causes of death among children according to the World Health Organization. Vaccines save lives by reducing the number of disease incidents. Avoiding or delaying vaccination can cause contraction of a commonly vaccinated disease leading to illness, permanent long term health effects, or even death. There is a strong link between vaccines and reduction of incidents</p>
    <object data="WorldMapPopCode/WorldMap.html" height=900 width =1700>Warning: WorldMap.html could not be included!</object>
	<p> The first and primary application is to enable a direct comparison between disease incidence
and vaccination rates for a given year. As we can see for Measles in 2003, the relationship
between disease rates and vaccination coverage is clearly visible. Mission accomplished!
We augmented this visualization by including a second application: Direct comparison between
diseases at different points in time. The broad impact of the measles vaccine can be easily
seen when comparing incidence rates in 2001 to those in 2016.
The fear of vaccination is founded in misinterpretation of science so our visualization is
designed to be accessible to parents disinclined to vaccinate their children by being simple,
direct, and easy to understand.
Detracting from this visualization is the lack of data. We have the ability to display data from
other diseases such as rubella and pertussis. However, as you can see, developed countries
such as the United States, Canada, and various European countries have not contributed their
data. More complete data would make visualizations such as these even more powerful.
Therefore, we believe that this visualization is useful not only to advocate for vaccination, but
also to advocate for proper record-keeping and public dissemination of this information. </p>
